This is PART 2 of my series deploy a simple web appplication in the cloud using Apache and AWS .  In PART 1, we deployed the infrastructure neccessary to host the website which we shall be deploying in this PART 2. To make it s simple as possible for beginners, we deployed the infrastructure in the default VPC, used one default subnet and one availability zone. We also used a t2.micro EC2 instance to minimize costs for this tutorial.
